# Pipa / Soprano
(the names may change in the future)

Soprano is a C library that Wrappers functions and syscalls to Win32 API and Vulkan to be used within Swift.

While Pipa is a Game Engine written in Swift using the Soprano lib ^^

( I AM MOVING MY OLD CODE IN C++ to Swift, I WILL UPDATE THE README AFTER THAT)
